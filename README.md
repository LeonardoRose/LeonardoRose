## Hi, I'm Leonardo Rose

## Data Analyst / Data Science Student 🚀

## About Me 👨‍💻
I graduated with a degree in Industrial Engineering and have been working as a Data Analyst for the past 5 years. I have experience across Operations, Product, Projects and Growth (customer acquistion). With strong technical skills, my expertise is about how to solve problems using data and translate those insights into business language. Seeking continuous growth, I'm currently studying Data Science to gain new knowledge and better ways to solve problems.

🟢 **I have experience in:**
- Building dataproducts from scratch to serve business team
- Customer segmentation
- Machine Learning Models (Regression, Classification, Clusterization)
- Modeling and linear optimization to define the best campaign for each customer
- Cohort Analysis
- Creating Dashboards

🧠 **And about technologies, I'm used with:**
- **Programming & Databases:** Python, SQL
- **Data Processing:** Databricks
- **ML & Modeling:** Scikit-learn, PuLP (Linear Programming)
- **Visualization:** Power BI
- **Spreadsheets:** Google Sheets

## 📝 My Projects 📝
### [Sales Forecast for a drugstore company with Linear Regression](https://github.com/LeonardoRose/Rossman_Store_Sales_Forecast)
- End-to-end solution where anyone can view the 6-week sales forecast for any Rossmann store
- I used XGBoost Regressor due its lowest MAPE: ~9.3%
### [Propensity Score with Classification](https://github.com/LeonardoRose/health_insurance_cross_sell)
- ML Model to calculate the propensity score for each customer to buy a health insurance 
- Best Model: Gradient Boosting Classifier, achieving a Recall at 40% of 93% (i.e., the top 40% of customers account for 93% of the total buyers)
- This represents a 117% revenues uplift
### [Fidelity Program with Clusterization - WIP](https://github.com/LeonardoRose/clusterization_fidelity_program)
- Project focused on creating customer segmentation using Clusterization ML Model 
- The main goal is to identify the premium customers and create a Fidelity Program for them
### _Linear Optimization - WIP_
- In order to boost driver connection time and increase the number of active drivers, the urban mobility company initiates campaigns providing financial bonuses for trip fulfillment.
- Following several A/B tests, performance metrics (conversion, connection time, and costs) were gathered for each campaign across all driver segments.
- In this project I developed a Linear Optimization Solver to identify the optimal campaign mix, maximizing company results based on current objectives (driver time or active drivers) and operational restrictions (budget and eligible drivers).
