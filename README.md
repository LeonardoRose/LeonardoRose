## Hi, I'm Leonardo Rose

## Data Analyst

## About Me 👨‍💻
I graduated in Industrial Engineer and working as Data Analyst for the past 5 years, I have experience with Operations, Product, Projects and Growth (customer acquistion). With strong technical skills, my expertise is about how to solve problems using data and translate those insights into business language. To keep improving myself, I'm currently studying Data Science seeking new knowledge and better ways to solve problems.

🟢 **I have experience in:**
- Building dataproducts from scratch to serve business team
- Customer segmentation
- Machine Learning Models (Regression, Classification, Clusterization)
- Modeling and linear optimization to define the best campaign for each customer
- Cohort Analysis
- Creating Dashboards

🧠 **And about technologies, I'm used with:**
- **Programming & Databases:** Python, SQL
- **Data Processing:** Databricks
- **ML & Modeling:** Scikit-learn, PuLP (Linear Programming)
- **Visualization:** Power BI
- **Spreadsheets:** Google Sheets

## My Projects
### [Sales Forecast for a drugstore company using Linear Regression](https://github.com/LeonardoRose/Rossman_Store_Sales_Forecast)
- End-to-end solution where anyone can view the 6-week sales forecast for any Rossmann store
- I used XGBoost Regressor due its lowest MAPE: ~9.3%
### [Propensity Score with Classification](https://github.com/LeonardoRose/health_insurance_cross_sell)
- ML Model to calculate the propensity score for each customer to buy a health insurance 
- Best Model: Gradient Boosting Classifier, achieving a Recall at 40% of 93% (i.e., the top 40% of customers account for 93% of the total buyers)
- This represents a 117% revenues uplift
### [Fidelity Program with Clusterization](https://github.com/LeonardoRose/clusterization_fidelity_program)
- Project focused on creating customer segmentation using Clusterization ML Model 
- The main goal is to identify the premium customers and create a Fidelity Program for them
### _Linear Optimization Loading_
- A urban mobility company sends campaigns (extra money if they complete extra runs) to their drivers to increase the time connected and the number of active drivers
- After several AB Tests to better understand the elasticity about its campaigns
